## Objectives of the Koreastudies (BA) Thesis

The Koreastudies Bachelor of Arts program at Leiden University provides students with an integrative framework for analyzing Korea's role within global dynamics from a humanities perspective. The program examines Korea's influence and regional interactions through an interdisciplinary approach encompassing culture, history, politics, and economics.

The BA thesis is the capstone project in the program. The thesis aims to enable students to:

1. Use up-to-date research methodologies relevant to the disciplines within Korean Studies
2. Engage with and comprehend complex academic discussions related to Korean Studies
3. Articulate their research findings and analyses in scholarly English
4. Manage their research projects within given deadlines, demonstrating the ability to perform under pressure

### Key Skills Developed

1. **Research Question Formulation:** Craft a clear and focused research question informed by a comprehensive review of the relevant literature
2. **Literature Appraisal:** Evaluate existing literature to determine its quality and reliability
3. **Planning and Execution:** Develop and implement a research project under academic supervision that integrates appropriate research methodologies
4. **Presentation of Findings:** Communicate research results in a clear, coherent, and well-structured written format that presents a sound argumentative framework based on empirical evidence

---

## Assessment Criteria

The thesis must meet a length requirement of **10,000 words (+/- 10%)**. Manuscripts are assessed according to four general criteria:

| Assessment Item | Associated Thesis Section(s) | Associated Components |
|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1. Knowledge and insight (contents, relation to the field) | Introduction, Literature Review | Research question and motivation; research problem; research gap; literature review |
| 2. Application of knowledge and insight (methodology) | Analytical Framework, Research Findings | Source material; data; methods; analytical frameworks and models; research findings |
| 3. Reaching conclusions (interpretation, argumentation, conclusion) | Conclusion & Discussion | Synthesis of findings; summary of research; discussion of findings; contribution of research |
| 4. Communication (writing and structure) | Entire thesis | Readability; style; spelling; grammar; terminology; citations and references; bibliography |

## Thesis Expectations

### Knowledge and Insight (Contents, Relation to the Field)

This assessment item relates to the research question, research motivation, and how the research is situated within an existing body of literature. The research question should reflect insight into the key discussions and methods of the field, ensuring clarity, relevance, and definition of the problem. It should be well-embedded in existing literature and demonstrate originality.

### Application of Knowledge and Insight (Data, Methodology)

Expectations include a critical analysis of primary material or sources, demonstrating the use of concepts and effective research methods. Secondary sources should be advanced and academic, with a clear description and justification of the adopted method.

### Reaching Conclusions (Interpretation, Argumentation, Conclusion)

Conclusions should be logical and well-founded, following logically from the analyzed material, with empirical analysis playing a crucial role in deriving insights. The degree to which the thesis question is answered and results are connected to other and future research is important.

### Communication (Writing and Structure)

Language use should be competent in terms of readability, style, spelling, grammar, and correct terminology. The structure and layout should be clear, including division into chapters and sections, table of contents, and illustrations. The thesis should include correct use of reference guidelines and a complete list of references.

## Analytical Framework Guidelines

The analytical framework (also called methodology, empirical strategy, or data and methods) explains procedures and techniques for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This section is critical to the thesis project.

### Key Components

**Introduction:** Begin with a concise summary of your methodological approach, justifying your selection of specific methods in relation to your research question and theoretical framework.

**Design:** Specify whether your study adopts a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods design. Justify your design choice based on the nature of your research question. Define geographic, temporal, and sociopolitical boundaries.

**Sources and Selection:** Detail the types of data sources used, criteria for selection, and procedures for data collection. Explain how disciplinary methodologies shape your selection process.

**Method:** Describe analytical techniques for processing data, including procedures for source translation, content analysis, statistical modeling, discourse or visual analysis, and close reading.

**Ethical Considerations:** Outline ethical issues pertinent to your research, including consent, anonymity, and permissions.

**Limitations:** Acknowledge limitations of your methodological approach, including potential biases and data availability issues.

## Plagiarism Note

Plagiarism involves presenting another person's work or ideas as your own. This includes using direct quotations without appropriate citations or appropriating someone else's work without acknowledgment. Even inadvertently, failure to use quotation marks for direct quotes constitutes an academic offense.

Materials sourced from the internet are subject to the same rigorous citation standards as traditional sources. Any plagiarism will be addressed in alignment with the university's established rules and disciplinary practices.
