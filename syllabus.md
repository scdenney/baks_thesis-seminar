## Course Description

This seminar is designed to introduce students to and support them through the senior year thesis writing and research process. It provides students with the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to plan and write an original, well-researched thesis on a topic of their own choosing. The seminar consists of lectures and workshop-style classes, as well as individual supervision meetings, all of which assist the student in completing the research and writing of the thesis.

The final thesis should demonstrate knowledge and skills relevant to the discipline of Koreastudies, including language ability; knowledge of history, politics, or culture; theory and methodology; and academic writing skills.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. Demonstrate the ability to identify a sufficiently interesting research question that can be answered given the time constraints and data restrictions of the BA thesis project.
2. Utilize a range of primary and secondary sources, including sources in Korean, to situate the thesis within the relevant literature and respond to the chosen research question.
3. Develop an appropriate analytical framework to answer the chosen research question.
4. Produce original academic writing that adheres to appropriate stylistic conventions for the discipline and academic standards of scholarly excellence.

Students are expected to attend all seminar meetings and actively participate in discussions and workshops. Attendance is mandatory. More than two unexcused absences may result in a failing grade for participation. Students who cannot attend a session should notify the instructor in advance.

### Late Submissions

Late submissions will be penalized unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor. Extensions must be requested at least 48 hours before the deadline and will only be granted in exceptional circumstances with appropriate documentation.

### Academic Honesty

All work submitted must be original and properly cited. Plagiarism, including the use of AI-generated text presented as one's own work without disclosure, will not be tolerated. Students are expected to adhere to Leiden University's academic integrity policies. See the [Regulations on Plagiarism](https://www.organisatiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/regulations/general/plagiarism-regulations) for more information.

### Generative AI Policy

Generative AI tools may be used as research aids, but all written work must reflect the student's own analysis and writing. Use of AI must be disclosed, and AI-generated content cannot substitute for original scholarly work. Undisclosed use of AI to generate thesis content will be treated as an academic integrity violation.
