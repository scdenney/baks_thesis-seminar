# Plan for Week 03

## Review from Week 2 (~20 min)
- Roundtable: each student (re)states their research question, motivation (2-3 sentences), and tells us what type of data they have, will, plan, or think they might collect
- Brief recap: question, problem, analysis — the three things they should be able to state clearly
- Transition: today we focus on how the literature review connects all three

## Types of Literature Reviews (~25 min)
- Purpose of a lit review (not a summary — it's a critical analysis that situates, identifies gaps, motivates methods, and establishes credibility)
- Where the lit review fits in the thesis structure
- Six types: argumentative, integrative, historical, methodological, systematic, theoretical
- Recap slide — emphasize they will mix and match
- Reflect: What is your "literature"? What kind of sources? What kind of review?

## Break (10 min)

## Best Practices (~15 min)
- Preparation: clarify question, targeted searches, collect and organize
- Organization: chronological, thematic, methodological, combination
- Reading: summarize and evaluate, annotated bibliography, track links, reference management (Zotero)
- Writing tips: integrate sources, find patterns, note conflicts, revisit and refine

## Example: Taiwan National Identity Paper (~15 min)
- Paper: "Measuring National Identity with Conjoint Experiments: The Case of Taiwan" (Denney, Steinhardt, Qi)
- Walk through the question, problem, and how the lit review is structured thematically:
  1. National identity as multidimensional (concept)
  2. Democracy and national identity (theory)
  3. Limitations of existing measurement (gap)
  4. The conjoint solution (method)
- What makes it work: thematic not source-by-source, each theme serves a purpose, builds an argument, mixes review types
- Simple template students can adapt: What is known? What is debated? What is missing? How will you fill it?

## Exercise & Next Steps (~5 min)
- Exercise: annotated bibliography (min. 5 sources) + draft outline of lit review
- Due to Brightspace by 23:59 on February 26 (Thursday)
- Looking ahead: week 4 on analysis and reporting; Assignment #1 due March 13
