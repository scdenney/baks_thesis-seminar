## Course Information

**Course Code:** 5723VKO1Y<br>
**Term:** AY2025-2026 (Spring)<br>
**Instructor:** Dr. Steven Denney ([s.c.denney@hum.leidenuniv.nl](mailto:s.c.denney@hum.leidenuniv.nl))<br>
**Time:** Fridays, 09:15-11:00<br>
**Location:** Lipsius 2.05, Workgroup 103

The thesis seminar guides students through each stage of the thesis-writing process: developing and refining a research question; identifying and engaging relevant literature, data, and sources; selecting appropriate theoretical frameworks and research designs; applying suitable methods; and organizing a coherent and persuasive thesis.

The bachelor's thesis, a 10,000-word research paper (±10% margin), represents the culmination of your undergraduate studies in Korean Studies. As the final major academic endeavor of the curriculum, the thesis presents a rewarding challenge and a great opportunity for academic and personal growth.

**Important:** Attendance is mandatory. A thesis cannot be submitted outside the seminar context. Time management is crucial for meeting deadlines.

---

## Course Objectives

Students are expected to:

- Engage with academic debates and scholarly discussions
- Read selected literature in academic writing and research
- Communicate research findings effectively in both written and spoken English
- Participate actively and knowledgeably in seminar discussions
- Apply current research methods relevant to their research project

Students will develop the following academic skills:

- Specify a research question appropriate to the field of Korean Studies
- Formulate a well-defined research problem based on a thorough literature review
- Locate and compile specialized literature using traditional and digital research tools
- Critically evaluate the quality and reliability of sources in English and Korean
- Design and conduct a supervised research study using relevant methods and techniques
- Draw evidence-based conclusions from the research conducted

## Policies

### Attendance

A strict attendance policy is in effect:
- Missing more than three sessions may result in being barred from further attendance and may lead to your paper not being graded
- Any absences must be communicated in advance
- Dispensation for extenuating circumstances can only be granted by the Board of Examiners

### Academic Honesty & GenAI

Plagiarism is a serious academic offense. Borrowing an idea or using a sentence from another's work without proper citation will result in course failure.

Generative AI tools may be used only in ethical, responsible, and transparent ways, in accordance with Leiden University Faculty of Humanities guidelines. Unless explicitly permitted, AI-generated content may not be submitted as your own work; any approved use must be disclosed and properly cited.

### Disability Accommodation

If you would like to request academic accommodations due to a disability, please meet with the instructor early in the semester and follow the formal process through the [study advisor](https://www.student.universiteitleiden.nl/en/study--studying/exceptional-circumstances/disability/humanities/ba-korean-studies).

## Boot Camp (Weeks 1-4)

The first four weeks provide structured training in research fundamentals before students transition to independent work with their supervisors.

### Week 1: Research Question

**February 06: Developing a Research Question and Identifying the Research Problem**

**Objectives:**
- Understand what makes a good research question
- Learn how to identify a research problem or gap in the literature
- Introduce the structure of an academic research manuscript

**Reading:**
- Introduction and Part I of Mullaney, Thomas S., and Christopher Rea. *Where Research Begins: Choosing a Research Project That Matters to You (and the World)*. University of Chicago Press, 2022. ([PDF]({{ '/readings/Mullaney_Rea_Where_Research_Begins.pdf' | relative_url }})

**Class Plan:**
- Define the structure of an academic research paper (introduction, research problem, research question)
- Discuss what constitutes a strong research question: clarity, relevance, and specificity
- Explain the concept of a research gap and strategies for identifying gaps in Korean Studies literature
- Workshop: Students brainstorm research questions and possible gaps

**Exercise:** Revise/draft a research question and identify the research problem. Provide a brief explanation of the gap your research will address.

---

### Week 2: Data and Sources

**February 13: Data and Sources – Generation, Collection, and FAIR Principles**

**Objectives:**
- Learn about primary and secondary data collection and management
- Introduce the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) framework

**Class Plan:**
- Differentiate between types of data: primary vs. secondary sources, qualitative vs. quantitative
- Discuss the importance of using Korean-language sources in Korean Studies research
- Define and explain each element of the FAIR principles and their relevance to research data management
- Discuss methods for generating and collecting primary data (interviews, surveys, archival research)
- Workshop: Students develop data collection plans applying FAIR principles

**Exercise:** Generate a plan outlining the type of data you intend to collect, how you will collect it, and how it aligns with the FAIR principles.

---

### Week 3: Literature Review

**February 20: Conducting a Literature Review**

**Objectives:**
- Understand the purpose and structure of a literature review
- Learn how to connect the literature review to research questions, gaps, and frameworks

**Class Plan:**
- Define the literature review's role: summarizing existing work, identifying gaps, framing the research problem
- Discuss how literature reviews serve as a foundation for developing a research question and theoretical framework
- Strategies for organizing literature reviews: chronological, thematic, methodological approaches
- Explain how to critically assess and synthesize literature to justify the research problem
- Show how a strong literature review links the research question, gap, and theoretical framework
- Workshop: Students begin outlining their literature review

**Exercise:** Generate an annotated bibliography and a draft outline of the literature review. Include key sources and explain how they connect to the research question and gap.

---

### Week 4: Analysis and Reporting

**February 27: Analysis and Reporting – Empirical Strategies for Data Interpretation**

**Objectives:**
- Review methods for analyzing research data
- Discuss strategies for reporting empirical findings in a structured manner

**Class Plan:**
- Overview of analysis methods: qualitative (thematic, content analysis) and quantitative (descriptive, inferential statistics)
- Focus on approaches appropriate to qualitative analysis using primary sources (e.g., newspapers)
- Examples from Korean Studies of how to apply these methods
- Discuss how to structure the findings section, linking back to the research question and literature review
- Workshop: Students review examples of well-structured findings sections

**Exercise:** Outline how you will analyze and present your data, focusing on connecting findings to the research problem and literature review.
