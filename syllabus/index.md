## Course Policies

### Attendance and Participation

Students are expected to attend all seminar meetings and actively participate in discussions and workshops. Attendance is mandatory. More than two unexcused absences may result in a failing grade for participation. Students who cannot attend a session should notify the instructor in advance.

### Late Submissions

Late submissions will be penalized unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor. Extensions must be requested at least 48 hours before the deadline and will only be granted in exceptional circumstances with appropriate documentation.

### Academic Honesty

All work submitted must be original and properly cited. Plagiarism, including the use of AI-generated text presented as one's own work without disclosure, will not be tolerated. Students are expected to adhere to Leiden University's academic integrity policies. See the [Regulations on Plagiarism](https://www.organisatiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/regulations/general/plagiarism-regulations) for more information.

### Generative AI Policy

Generative AI tools may be used as research aids, but all written work must reflect the student's own analysis and writing. Use of AI must be disclosed, and AI-generated content cannot substitute for original scholarly work. Undisclosed use of AI to generate thesis content will be treated as an academic integrity violation.

### Disability Accommodations

Students requiring accommodations due to a disability should contact the instructor and [Fenestra Disability Centre](https://www.student.universiteitleiden.nl/en/study--studying/exceptional-circumstances/disability/humanities/ba-korean-studies) as early as possible to discuss appropriate arrangements.
