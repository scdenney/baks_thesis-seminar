## Course Description

This seminar supports students through the senior year thesis writing and research process. It provides the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to plan and write an original, well-researched thesis on a topic of your own choosing. The seminar consists of lectures and workshop-style classes, as well as individual supervision meetings, all designed to assist you in completing your thesis.

The final thesis should demonstrate knowledge and skills relevant to the discipline of Koreastudies, including language ability; knowledge of history, politics, or culture; theory and methodology; and academic writing skills.
