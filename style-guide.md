## Structure

### Title Page

Place the **title and subtitle** in the upper portion. In the lower portion include:
- Student name
- Student number
- Email address
- Initials and surname of the first reader (supervisor)
- Degree title
- Academic year
- Word count (excluding bibliography and appendices)

### Abstract and Keywords

The title page is followed by an **abstract** of approximately 150 words describing the topic, findings, and conclusion. Below the abstract, include a **list of five keywords** covering the scope of the research.

### Main Body

The main body should contain:
1. **Introduction** - What does your research question relate and respond to
2. **Literature Review** - How the subject has been treated previously
3. **Methodology** - How you will answer your question (where appropriate)

### Korean Sources in Footnotes and Bibliography

Include:
1. Romanized author name (family name first)
2. Romanized title
3. Original Korean title in brackets
4. Standard bibliographic information

**Book (footnote):**
> Paek Haksun, *Pukhan kwollyogui yoksa: sasang, chongch'esong, kujo* [북한 권력의 역사: 사상, 정체성, 구조] (Hanul, 2010), 115.

### Korean Media with English Names

Use the English name with Han'gul for clarity:

### Translations

When translating sentences, place the original Korean in brackets if helpful:
> "Only 23.4% said he has to join the Democratic Party (DP) [민주당에 입당해야 한다]."

For institutions, place Korean in parentheses:
> Korea Society Opinion Institute (KSOI) (한국사회여론연구소)
